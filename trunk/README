With this component you can integrate simpleSAMLphp with DokuWiki?, enabling
federated login with an SAML 2.0 or Shibboleth 1.3 IdP. It's a authentication
plugin for DokuWiki which uses a simpleSAMLphp installation on the same host.

This package assumes you've installed and configured both simpleSAMLphp and
DokuWiki already. For more information about each of the individual parts,
see:
 * http://www.dokuwiki.org/
 * http://www.simplesamlphp.org/

The module has been tested with DokuWiki 20080505 and simpleSAMLphp 1.6.2.

Steps to install:

0. Ensure that DokuWiki and simpleSAMLphp are installed and working, as
   per above.

1. Put the file auth/simplesamlphp.class.php into DokuWiki's inc/auth/
   directory, or symlink it into there.

2. Edit DokuWiki's local.php (or create it), and add at least the following
   settings:

     // enable the simplesamlphp authentication plugin:
     $conf['authtype'] = 'simplesamlphp';
     // point DokuWiki the path where you installed simpleSAMLphp:
     $conf['simplesamlphp_path'] = '/usr/share/simplesamlphp';
     // define which attributes to use for DokuWiki:
     // user: a username displayed in page history and last modified notifications
     $conf['simplesamlphp_attr_user'] = 'urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:eduPersonPrincipalName';
     // name: a human-readable displayname for this user
     $conf['simplesamlphp_attr_name'] = 'urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:cn';
     // mail: optional, but necessary when enabling page change notifications
     $conf['simplesamlphp_attr_mail']     = 'urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:mail';
     // groups: optional, can be used in ACL's to authorize certain parts to certai user groups
     $conf['simplesamlphp_attr_grps']     = 'groups';

   Other settings that may be of interest:
     // Do not let users register themselves in DokuWiki directly
     $conf['openregister'] = 0;
     // Determine who can access what through access control lists:
     $conf['useacl'] = 1;
     // Present a login screen before users can even view DokuWiki:
     $conf['requirelogin'] = 'false';

3. Ensure that DokuWiki and simpleSAMLphp can share a cookie. You can do this
   by changing DokuWiki itself, but probably easiest is to change
   simpleSAMLphp's config/config.php cookiename setting:

     'session.phpsession.cookiename'  => 'DokuWiki'


Note on ACL's: if your user attribute contains 'special' characters, you need
to urlencode these before you put them in your acl.auth.php. The exact
encoding is in inc/auth.php:auth_nameencode(), which boils down to urlencoding
each ASCII character not in [A-Za-z0-9]. For example: 'username@example.org'
needs to be put into the acl as: 'username%40example%2eorg'.
